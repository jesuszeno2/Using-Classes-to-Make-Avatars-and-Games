# Using Classes to Make Avatars and Games
For this assignment, I needed to implement two classes Avatar and Game. 

## The Game Class Should Possess the Following:
- The Game object will initialize without Avatar objects
- The startGame method initializes an internal empty list of avatar objects
- A method to add one avatar object to the game at a time
- A method to animate all current objects in game
- A method to stop the game which destroys all the avatar objects in its internal list

## The Avatar Class Should Posses the Following:
- Resemble simple human type avatars with attributes such as: name, hair color, height, gender, and superpower.
- A method to change an avatar's hair color  
- A method to change an avatar's superpower
- A method to animate the avatar
- The animate method prints out the object's variables

The Main program creates four different avatar objects that resemble characters from the Super Mario series. It creates a super mario game object and animates all the characters in the game once.
